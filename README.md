# Simple CNN with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch. The CNN is designed to classify images into categories (e.g., digits in the MNIST dataset). The model consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and two fully connected layers.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- torchvision 0.8 or higher (for datasets and transformations)

Other dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/langiq-ai/simple-pytorch-cnn.git
    cd simple-cnn-pytorch
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. If you plan to use a GPU for training, ensure that CUDA is installed and that your PyTorch version supports GPU. You can check this by running:
    ```bash
    python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model
You can train the CNN on any image dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR) by running the `train.py` script. For example, to train the model on the MNIST dataset:
```bash
python train.py --dataset mnist --epochs 10 --batch-size 64 --learning-rate 0.001
```

Available Arguments:
--dataset: Dataset to use (e.g., mnist, cifar10)
--epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 10)
--batch-size: Batch size for training (default: 64)
--learning-rate: Learning rate for optimizer (default: 0.001)

### 2. Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model on a test set by running the evaluate.py script. For example:

## Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model, run the following command:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset mnist --model-path path/to/saved_model.pth
```
### Available Arguments:
- `--dataset`: Dataset to evaluate on (e.g., mnist, cifar10)
- `--model-path`: Path to the saved model checkpoint



## Training
The `train.py` script handles the training loop, where the model learns from a dataset using backpropagation. The training script:

1. Loads the dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR).
2. Defines the model, loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss), and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
3. Runs the training loop for the specified number of epochs.
4. Saves the trained model to disk for later evaluation.

You can tweak hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and epochs through command-line arguments.

## Evaluation
The `evaluate.py` script is used to test the trained model on unseen data. It loads the saved model checkpoint and evaluates performance metrics such as accuracy. The evaluation process includes:

1. Loading the test dataset.
2. Loading the trained model.
3. Running inference on the test data.
4. Displaying the accuracy and loss.

## Customization
You can customize the model, dataset, or training process by editing the appropriate files:

- **Model Architecture:** Modify `model.py` to add or change convolutional layers, activation functions, or fully connected layers.
- **Datasets:** Add custom datasets or modify the data loading and augmentation process in `utils.py`.
- **Training Script:** Customize the training process in `train.py` by adding different optimizers, learning rate schedules, or other training techniques.
